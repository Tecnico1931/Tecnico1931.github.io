## The Path from Technician to Director

My career in technology didn't start with a CS degree or a coding bootcamp. It started with fixing computers at Geek Squad and a genuine curiosity about how systems work. That hands-on foundation -- understanding technology from the ground up -- has shaped how I lead engineering teams today.

From there, I moved through technology roles at media companies and global advertising agencies like Ogilvy and BBH, where I learned that technology exists to serve the business, not the other way around. Every system I built, every process I improved, was measured by the impact it had on the people using it.

At Cornell University, I managed client platforms at scale in a complex institutional environment. That experience taught me how to think about reliability, standardization, and supporting diverse user needs -- lessons that proved invaluable as I moved into infrastructure and DevOps.

### Oscar Health: Where It Clicked

Oscar Health was where my career trajectory shifted. Working at a health-tech startup that was reimagining health insurance through technology, I grew from engineer to senior engineer to lead. I saw firsthand how infrastructure decisions directly impact a product's ability to serve its users -- in this case, people depending on their health insurance to work.

### Peloton: Building from the Ground Up

I joined Peloton as a DevOps Engineer when the engineering organization was still finding its footing. I had the opportunity to build DevOps practices from scratch -- establishing the infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and operational standards that would need to scale as Peloton grew into a household name.

Over the years at Peloton, I progressed through Lead DevOps Engineer, Manager, Senior Manager, and Director of Engineering. Each step brought new challenges: hiring and developing engineers, aligning technical strategy with business goals, and maintaining engineering excellence while moving fast.

### How I Lead

I believe the best engineering leaders are the ones who never forget what it's like to be in the trenches. My leadership style is rooted in:

- **Technical credibility** -- I've done the work. I understand what I'm asking my teams to build because I've built it myself.
- **People first** -- Great technology comes from great teams. I invest heavily in hiring, mentoring, and creating environments where engineers can do their best work.
- **Pragmatism over perfection** -- Ship it, learn from it, improve it. I favor practical solutions that deliver value over architecturally pure systems that never launch.
- **Cross-functional partnership** -- Engineering doesn't operate in a vacuum. The best outcomes come from tight collaboration with product, design, and business teams.

### Beyond Work

I'm an active member of the Mac administration and open source community, contributing tools and automation that help other engineers work more effectively. I believe in giving back to the communities that helped me grow.
