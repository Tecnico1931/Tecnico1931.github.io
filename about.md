## The Path from Technician to Director

My career in technology didn't start with a CS degree or a coding bootcamp. It started with fixing computers at Geek Squad and a genuine curiosity about how systems work. That hands-on foundation -- understanding technology from the ground up -- has shaped how I lead engineering teams today.

From there, I moved through technology roles at media companies and global advertising agencies like Ogilvy and BBH, where I learned that technology exists to serve the business, not the other way around. Every system I built, every process I improved, was measured by the impact it had on the people using it.

At Cornell University, I managed client platforms at scale in a complex institutional environment. That experience taught me how to think about reliability, standardization, and supporting diverse user needs -- lessons that proved invaluable as I moved into infrastructure and DevOps.

### Oscar Health: Where It Clicked

Oscar Health was where my career trajectory shifted. Working at a health-tech startup that was reimagining health insurance through technology, I grew from engineer to senior engineer to lead engineer over three years. I saw firsthand how infrastructure decisions directly impact a product's ability to serve its users -- in this case, people depending on their health insurance to work. The stakes were real, and the technical challenges were substantial.

### Peloton: Building from the Ground Up

I joined Peloton as a DevOps Engineer in 2013 when the engineering organization was still finding its footing. I had the rare opportunity to build DevOps practices from scratch -- establishing the infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and operational standards that would need to scale as Peloton grew into a household name with millions of connected users globally.

Over more than a decade at Peloton, I progressed through Lead DevOps Engineer, Manager, Senior Manager, and Director of Engineering. Each step brought new challenges: building teams from 5 to 15+ engineers, hiring and developing talent, aligning technical strategy with business goals, and maintaining engineering excellence while moving at startup speed through hyper-growth. I've had the privilege of building the infrastructure foundation that powers a global connected fitness platform, while growing as a leader alongside the company.

### How I Lead

I believe the best engineering leaders are the ones who never forget what it's like to be in the trenches. My leadership philosophy is rooted in:

- **Technical credibility** -- I've done the work. I understand what I'm asking my teams to build because I've built it myself, from infrastructure automation to CI/CD pipelines to on-call incident response.
- **People first** -- Great technology comes from great teams. I invest heavily in hiring, mentoring, and creating environments where engineers can do their best work. I've grown teams from 5 to 15+ engineers through thoughtful hiring and career development.
- **Pragmatism over perfection** -- Ship it, learn from it, improve it. I favor practical solutions that deliver value over architecturally pure systems that never launch. Operational excellence doesn't mean zero risk -- it means calculated risk with proper monitoring and rollback plans.
- **Cross-functional partnership** -- Engineering doesn't operate in a vacuum. The best outcomes come from tight collaboration with product, design, and business teams. I work closely with C-level executives and stakeholders to align technical investments with business objectives.
- **Scale through systems** -- As organizations grow, leadership shifts from doing to enabling. I build systems, processes, and culture that allow teams to scale without sacrificing quality or speed.

### Community & Speaking

I'm an active member of the Mac administration, DevOps, and video technology communities with 2,000+ followers and a network of 500+ professional connections. I contribute to open source projects, share knowledge through technical discussions, and participate in industry conferences.

**Conference Participation:**
- MacDevOps:YVR -- Annual DevOps conference focused on Mac and Apple platform engineering
- MacSysAdmin -- European Mac systems administration conference
- MacAdmins Conference at Penn State
- Active participant in MacAdmins Slack community and local DevOps meetups

**Community Leadership:**
- Host of [Video Tech NYC](https://www.meetup.com/video-tech-nyc/) meetup group -- bringing together video streaming engineers in NYC
- Active member of [video-dev.org](https://www.video-dev.org/) Slack community -- engaging with video technology professionals globally
- Member of the [@autopkg](https://github.com/autopkg) organization
- Maintain 53+ public repositories focused on infrastructure automation and Mac platform engineering

I believe in giving back to the communities that helped me grow, through code contributions, meetup hosting, mentorship, and knowledge sharing.

### Languages

Native fluency in both English and Spanish, enabling effective communication with diverse teams and global organizations.
